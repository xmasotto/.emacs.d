Emacs24 Configuration

Features:
- (require-package) installs packages if they don't exist
- 9 shell buffers accessible with ALT-(1..9)
- Winner mode mapped to M-left and M-right
- Helm mode mapped to M-space
- Autosave and backup files given their own directory

Todo:
- make sure java uses spaces instead of tabs
- make it easy to switch c-basic offset
- make the emacs terminals run .emacs.d/bashrc, so special commands can be used
inside an emacs terminal (like running emacsclient)
